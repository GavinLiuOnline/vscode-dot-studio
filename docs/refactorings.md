# Refactorings

The C# extension's language server offers most refactorings in the lightbulb menu (Ctrl+.): rename, extract method, generate constructor and many more. This extension adds the ones Visual Studio has and the server lacks. They appear in the same menu, next to the server's own.

Refactorings that need choices ask them in a form in the editor area, like a dialog: it opens as a tab in front of your file. **OK** (or Enter) applies, **Cancel**, **Esc** or closing the tab drops the refactoring and changes nothing.

## Extract Interface

Put the cursor on the name of a class, struct or record and press Ctrl+. > **Extract interface (choose members)...** (the server's own *Extract interface...* next to it takes every public member without asking).

The form has:
- **New interface name:** `I` plus the type's name; it must be a C# identifier.
- **Generate into:** a **new file** next to the type (`IOrder.cs`, with the usings and the namespace of the type's file; the default, like Visual Studio) or **the same file**, above the type.
- **Select public members to form interface:** the type's public instance methods, properties (indexers too) and events, all checked; **Select All** and **Deselect All**. A preview on the right shows the interface as it will be written.

On OK the interface is created and the type gets it as a base type (`public class Order : IOrder`). The new file and the edited file stay open and unsaved, so Ctrl+Z undoes it; if the new file already exists you are told and nothing changes.

Not covered yet: the interface does not get the type's generic constraints, and members with explicit interface implementations or `internal` visibility are not listed.

## Needs

A C# extension that has the language server (`ms-dotnettools.csharp` or `muhammad-sammy.csharp`, with its Roslyn server, not OmniSharp). The refactorings are a small .NET assembly (`out/server-extension/Shinobi.Refactorings.dll`, built with the extension) that the C# extension hands to its server; nothing else is installed.
